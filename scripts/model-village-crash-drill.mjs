/**
 * MV-B5 process-crash durability drill harness (Model Village experiment
 * backend, durability slice).
 *
 * Turns the spec's *claimed* file-state fault-boundary property
 * (docs/specs/HOLOLAND_MODEL_VILLAGE_EXPERIMENT.md gate rows 578/581 —
 * "A fresh Node process rereads the validated state. Process-level exceptions
 * immediately before/after rename expose the old or complete file state.")
 * into an EXECUTED, RECEIPTED drill: it spawns a real child process that
 * performs a real sealed-store / persistent-state operation, kills that child
 * with SIGKILL at a chosen crash window, then opens/recovers the store in a
 * SEPARATE fresh process and asserts the durability invariant. Every run emits
 * a signed-by-hash receipt whose invariant outcome is recorded honestly — a
 * real durability gap is receipted with invariantHeld:false, never masked.
 *
 * CLAIM BOUNDARY (read before citing this harness):
 *   - Proves SINGLE-HOST process-crash durability and SAME-HOST multi-process
 *     contention behavior only.
 *   - Does NOT claim production/fleet deployment, distributed (multi-host)
 *     consensus, or durability against media failure / OS fsync lies.
 *   - No directory fsync exists in either production store, so a completed
 *     rename/unlink can still be lost across true power loss on some
 *     filesystems (consistency-safe, not power-loss-durable). This harness
 *     tests the fault BOUNDARY (old-or-new-never-torn), not power-loss.
 *
 * MECHANISM NOTE (honesty): production writeAtomicState performs
 * temp-write -> fsync -> rename SYNCHRONOUSLY with no yield, and the custody
 * store's key-scrub / log-append windows are sub-syscall. Those exact
 * intra-syscall windows cannot be hit by an EXTERNAL SIGKILL, and the code
 * exposes only a partial fault seam that a NEW-FILE consumer can drive (the
 * injectable before_rename/after_rename fault and the commit functions are
 * still module-private in model-village-phase0b-runtime.mjs — see gapsFound).
 * For those windows the worker deterministically establishes the exact on-disk
 * state a crash at that window produces (orphan temp / partial log line /
 * post-commit key residue) using production code plus real file ops and is
 * THEN really SIGKILLed; recovery runs against 100% production recovery code.
 * Each receipt states its mechanism in observedOutcome. FOUR windows are caught
 * with no state modeling at all: the custody object-write (large ciphertext
 * write), the custody lock-held window (live lock holder), the phase0b
 * persistence lock leak (the worker holds a REAL production lock via
 * acquirePersistentStoreLock and is killed holding it, so its release never
 * runs), and the custody key-destruction ORDERING window (production
 * destroyContentKey is interrupted at the key scrub by a real filesystem
 * fault, so the state under test is produced by production code failing at the
 * ordering boundary rather than by the worker writing it).
 *
 * NEW FILE — reuses, never reimplements, MV-B1..B4 production scripts.

 * Both the emitter (runCrashDrill) and the verifier (verifyCrashDrillReceipt)
 * call this, and the verifier compares its own re-derivation against the value
 * carried in the receipt — so the claim cannot be asserted, only earned:
 *   - all three pids must be real (positive integers), so a `-1` placeholder
 *     from a failed/absent spawn can never certify anything;
 *   - the recovery pid must differ from the crashed worker's pid (otherwise
 *     "recovery" ran in the process it was proving crashed);
 *   - the recovery pid must differ from the harness's own pid (recovering
 *     inside the drill/gate process is not a fresh process either);
 *   - the WORKER pid must differ from the harness's own pid. This arm was
 *     missing until 2026-07-28 and its absence was a live hole: the
 *     `recoveryPid !== workerPid` arm is the one that proves "recovery did not
 *     run in the process it proved crashed", and it is vacuous whenever
 *     `workerPid` is not actually the crashed worker's pid. A one-token
 *     mutation (`workerPid: crash.pid` -> `workerPid: harnessPid`) previously
 *     derived TRUE while every drill line reported the gate's own pid as the
 *     SIGKILLed worker. The harness can never legitimately SIGKILL itself, so
 *     worker == harness is physically impossible, never a false red.
 *
 * FALSE-POSITIVE RATE ON CORRECT CODE: zero observed. A correct run spawns the
 * recovery child AFTER the crash worker has exited, so a worker/recovery
 * collision needs the OS to recycle a pid within milliseconds; the harness has
 * never produced one (the collision guard predates this change and has never
 * fired), and a child can never be handed its own parent's pid. This detector
 * reds only on genuinely degraded evidence.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT PROVE (measured, not guessed). Three plausible
 * distinct positive integers satisfy every arm. The pid triple is bound to a
 * really-executed recovery only by the SELF-REPORTED pid law in
 * runRecoveryProcess/runCrashDrill (the recovery child prints its own
 * process.pid and the harness refuses any receipt whose recoveryPid does not
 * equal it) — that law, not this function, is what defeats an emitter that
 * recovers in-process while spawning a throwaway child for a plausible pid.
 * A wholly FORGED receipt is still out of reach of both.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TORN-READ PROBE — the only thing here that measures the ATOMIC-REPLACEMENT
// mechanism itself.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS (audit finding, 2026-07-27, reproduced by execution before this
// was written): replacing writeAtomicState with a naive
// `writeFileSync(statePath, json)` — no temp file, no fsync, no rename — left
// EVERY existing gate green: the 9 crash drills all HELD (including the two
// literally named persistent-state-killed-before-rename and
// -after-rename), the durability checker exited 0 with allInvariantsHeld:true,
// and both node --test suites passed. The reason is structural, not a tuning
// problem: those two scenarios drive the faultInjection seam, and atomic
// replacement and a naive write leave the IDENTICAL observable state when that
// fault fires (prior state intact) and the IDENTICAL state once a write has
// settled. Nothing in the slice ever observed a state file WHILE it was being
// replaced, which is the only moment the two differ.
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT: atomic replacement means a reader never observes a
// partial state file. The new bytes are assembled at a private temp path and
// published by a single rename, so an opener sees either the old complete file
// or the new complete file — never a prefix. A naive direct write publishes at
// the target path: between the truncating open and the completed write, the
// target EXISTS and is short. That is a torn read, and it is the observable.
//
// HOW THIS MEASURES IT: a real writer child loops the real production write path
// (initializePersistentStore -> writeAtomicState) while N real reader children
// hammer the real production readPersistentState in a tight loop. Every read is
// classified from what it actually observed. A read that finds state.json
// PRESENT but unparseable/invalid is a torn read: a HIT. Absent (ENOENT) and
// OS-transient (EPERM/EBUSY delete-pending) reads are NOT hits — they are the
// proof the reader was inside a replacement window at all, and they are what
// makes "no torn read" mean something instead of meaning "nobody looked".

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ATOMIC REPLACEMENT PROBE (closes DEFECT A': the torn-read probe races the
// CREATE path only).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The torn-read probe above can only drive the one production
// writer a consumer can reach: initializePersistentStore, which REFUSES a live
// store (model-village-phase0b-runtime.mjs:2280), so its writeAtomicState call
// always runs with the target ABSENT. The production COMMIT path calls the same
// function with the target PRESENT (model-village-phase0b-runtime.mjs:2592) and
// is module-private. That was measured, not assumed: an implementation that is
// atomic on create and naive on replace passed the torn-read probe, both node
// --test suites, and this checker at exit 0 (see the M3 test in
// model-village-crash-drill.test.mjs). The receipt's headline was therefore
// claiming REPLACEMENT while measuring CREATION.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED HERE, AND HOW IT IS NOT A RACE. Atomic replacement's
// defining mechanism is that the published path acquires a DIFFERENT file
// object; an in-place rewrite keeps the same one and is torn-readable by
// construction between its truncating open and its completed write. That is
// observable directly from the OS: (dev, ino, birthtimeMs) is stable across an
// in-place write and changes across a rename. So the detector is DETERMINISTIC
// — per-replacement detection is 1 by construction, there is no trial count to
// size and no per-trial probability to derive. The only power question left is
// whether any replacement was executed at all, and that is COUNTED, with a
// floor, and reported UNMEASURED when it is not met.
//
// THE COMPARATOR ITSELF IS CONTROLLED. A host on which ino/birthtime cannot
// discriminate would otherwise turn this into a confident wrong answer, so
// every run first performs a known in-place rewrite and a known rename on a
// throwaway file and requires the comparator to call them same/different. If it
// cannot, the run is UNMEASURED, never HELD and never VIOLATED.
//
// THE SEAM. Production is NOT edited. The probe writes a byte-identical copy of
// the shipping runtime with exactly one line appended — `export {
// writeAtomicState };` — which cannot change the function's behaviour, and
// records the shipping file's sha256 plus the appended byte count in the
// receipt so a reader can check that claim. If the anchor is missing the run
// fails LOUD as UNMEASURED rather than silently skipping. This also finally
// drives the before_rename/after_rename fault seam ON THE REPLACEMENT PATH,
// which G-EXPORT recorded as undrivable.
//
// WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT COVER: an implementation that unlinks the target
// before renaming still changes the file identity, so it reads as atomic HERE
// while leaving a window in which state.json does not exist at all. That is
// G-VANISH. This probe's blindness to it is unchanged and is pinned by an
// executed test; the defect itself is now caught by the VANISH PROBE below.

//     a NEW file object, so the identity comparator reads it as atomic.
//
// This probe measures the property directly: on an ESTABLISHED store that this
// harness NEVER unlinks, a concurrent reader polling the published path must
// never observe it genuinely absent. The whole design turns on one distinction
// the previous attempt did not make — ENOENT (the entry is gone) is NOT the
// same observation as EPERM/EACCES/EBUSY (win32 delete-pending / sharing
// violation, which is exactly what a CORRECT rename-over-a-held-open-target
