/**
 * Resolves the H3A <-> H3B lineage pins in ONE topological pass.
 *
 * This script exists because the pair used to have no fixed point. H3A recorded H3B's
 * source hash (metadata.successorSourceSha256) while H3B recorded H3A's source, policy,
 * seed, manifest and report hashes. Editing either file invalidated the other's record,
 * and re-resolving the other invalidated the first -- a genuine cycle, so a lineage sweep
 * could never terminate.
 *
 * The cycle was removed by deleting successorSourceSha256 and replacing it with an
 * EXECUTED supersession proof (see proveSupersessionBoundary in the H3A checker), which
 * needs no hash of the successor at all. What is left is a strict DAG:
 *
 *     H3A source/policy/seed/checker/test/report
 *                  |
 *                  v
 *          H3A manifest  ------+
 *                              |
 *                              v
 *                        H3B source  ---->  H3B manifest
 *
 * Each stage below depends only on stages above it, so running them in order converges
 * in a single pass. If a second pass would ever change anything, --check says so.
 *
 * SCOPE DISCIPLINE. This refreshes only the LINEAGE pins listed here -- the ones this
 * change is expected to invalidate. Every other pinned artifact (atlases, hero renders,
 * LOD plates) is VERIFIED and reported, never rewritten, so a resolver run cannot quietly
 * paper over real asset drift.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/resolve-hololand-model-village-character-appearance-h3-lineage.mjs
 *   node scripts/resolve-hololand-model-village-character-appearance-h3-lineage.mjs --check

 *
 * A lineage pin records "I was witnessed against THIS version of my predecessor". It

 * a gate green -- verified below: every gate red for a non-lineage reason stays red.
