// Model Village RUN CONDUCTOR — the T-7 twelve-run dress rehearsal.
//
// docs/specs/HOLOLAND_MODEL_VILLAGE_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md line 726 requires, at
// T-7: "Complete a full twelve-run dress rehearsal using captured responses and
// zero provider calls." This module executes the run-day lifecycle (plan lines
// 764-782) twelve times — three seed blocks of four conditions in the frozen
// order (plan lines 735-739) — against CAPTURED responses read back out of
// sealed custody, with a measured provider-call count of zero.
//
// The rehearsal needs no live models and no open-outcome receipt tier: replayed
// captures make the final state predetermined, so the run is sealable by the
// EXISTING v4 receipt family. That is precisely why it is the cheapest
// falsification available to this lane, and why it is the first thing that
// should have been built.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR: composing five slices that were islands
// ===========================================================================
// MV-B1 model-turn receipt shape + proposal vocabulary  (adapter runtime)
// MV-B2 turn scheduler + per-run isolation              (scheduler + bridge)
// MV-B3 sealed alias-assignment vault                   (alias vault)
// MV-B4 validator custody + trust registry publication  (custody + registry)
// MV-B5 conductor (this file)                           the run that executes
//
// Before this file, model-village-alias-vault.mjs and
// model-village-trust-registry.mjs had ZERO production consumers — only their
// own checkers and tests imported them. This module is their first consumer,
// and it consumes them on the executing path, not in an assertion.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE THREE-LAYER EXECUTOR CONTRACT (the structural conflict, resolved)
// ===========================================================================
// MV-B2's createTurnScheduler and MV-B3's captureResponseUnderCustody BOTH
// claim the `turnExecutor` slot on MV-B1's executeCertifiedModelTurn. They
// cannot both hold it: the scheduler injects an executor per resident per
// round, while the capture lane wraps an executor to seal what it returns.
// Resolved here explicitly, with the conductor owning the slot:
//
//   Layer 1 — SHAPE is MV-B1's.   The replay executor returns a receipt that
//             satisfies verifyModelTurnReceipt unchanged: same 22 closed keys,
//             same schema, same engine pin, same zero-retry rule, same bounded
//             parsedProposal projection produced by MV-B1's exported
//             parseProposal over MV-B1's `.hs` vocabulary. Nothing about the
//             receipt contract is re-authored here.
//   Layer 2 — BYTES are MV-B3's.  The response bytes are read back OUT of the
//             run's sealed custody store by custodyId on every single turn
//             (custodyStore.readObject), never from an in-memory copy, and the
//             plaintext is re-hashed against the pinned responseHash before it
//             is parsed. That is a genuine custody round-trip, which is
//             exactly what MV-B3's capture lane exists to make possible.
//   Layer 3 — SLOT is MV-B2's, filled by the conductor. The scheduler keeps
//             every guarantee it enforces (frozen snapshot, bounded
//             concurrency, dispatch-relative deadline, zero retry, proposal
//             barrier before any adjudication, hash-chained adjudication); the
//             conductor merely supplies what it calls.
//
// The seam is one-directional: the conductor hands the scheduler an executor,
// and the executor reads MV-B3-sealed bytes. MV-B3's captureResponseUnderCustody
// is NOT wrapped around the scheduler's executor, because doing so would put a
// live provider call inside a rehearsal whose whole point is that there is
// none. Capture (write) and replay (read) are separate phases of the same
// custody, and this module is the read phase.
//
// ===========================================================================
// FOUR STRUCTURAL CONFLICTS FOUND BY RUNNING THE COMPOSITION, NOT BY READING IT
// ===========================================================================
// (1) MV-B2's policy is SEALED AGAINST MV-B3. source/proofs/
//     model-village-turn-policy.hs freezes "no blinded alias assignment is
//     performed, claimed, or receipted under this policy", and the scheduler's
//     loader ENFORCES that the laneStatement says so. A blinded study run can
//     therefore never be governed by mv-b2-turn-policy-v1. Resolved by a NEW
//     frozen source, source/proofs/model-village-study-policy.hs
//     (mv-study-policy-v1), whose laneStatement REQUIRES sealed alias
//     assignment. The frozen MV-B2 policy is untouched.
//
// (2) The scheduler's POLICY BUNDLE shape is closed. validatePolicyBundle
//     asserts EXACT keys on the bundle, the policy, the snapshot fixture, the
//     pre-authorized catalog, and the vocabulary. A study bundle carrying the
//     study block order and the wider action catalog is therefore inadmissible
//     as-is. Resolved by PROJECTION, not by relaxing the scheduler: the study
//     manifest carries everything, and `schedulerPolicyBundle` is the exact
//     eight-key projection the scheduler accepts, with its own recomputed
//     manifestHash/policyHash. Nothing in MV-B2 is edited or bypassed.
//
// (3) turnsPerRun 6 does NOT mean one scheduler round. executeTurnRound
//     hard-codes the opportunity id as `${runId}-t1-${residentId}` and refuses
//     to execute a runId twice on one scheduler. Six deterministic turns per
//     village-run are therefore six ROUNDS under six derived runIds on ONE
//     scheduler, so the scheduler-scoped nonce and opportunity registries span
//     the whole run and replay stays refused across turns. The rounds are
//     hash-chained end to end: round 1 chains from the SIGNED run manifest
//     hash, round n+1 chains from round n's terminal adjudication receipt.
//
// (4) MV-B4's issue() CANNOT sign a village run manifest, and that is why the
//     lane looked composed when it was not. createCustodyBackedValidator's
//     issue() self-verifies through the shipped verifyRuntimeInjectedValidator,
//     which calls assertRunManifest — and that pins
//     runId === 'mv-phase0b-tracer-001' and the frozen phase0b two-action
//     shape. B4 was signing the pre-existing tracer's manifest because that is
//     the ONLY manifest it can sign. Its verifyValidatorSignature likewise pins
//     payload.domain to the phase0b domain.
//     Resolved WITHOUT editing MV-B4 (its handle's key set is pinned by an
//     existing test, so a new method there would break it): the conductor
//     provisions the key through MV-B4's REAL custody path
//     (provisionValidatorKey seals the PKCS8 into the run's sealed store),
//     publishes it through MV-B4's REAL trust-registry lane
//     (createTrustRegistry/appendEntry), and signs the VILLAGE run manifest
//     under a DISTINCT domain — STUDY_RUN_MANIFEST_DOMAIN — so a study
//     signature can never be replayed as a phase0b run-manifest signature or
//     the reverse. Verification runs through MV-B4's own fleet primitive,
//     verifyRunManifestAgainstRegistry, with the adapter supplied HERE rather
//     than in a checker. The manifest that is signed and verified is the
//     conductor's own run manifest, which is the composition the audit found
//     missing.
//
// ===========================================================================
// CLAIM BOUNDARY — observed{} vs declared{}, and why they are separated
// ===========================================================================
// The audit that preceded this file found 570 pinned claim flags across the
// lane of which only 7 had a load-bearing test, and checkers that verified a
// receipt against the same constant they wrote it from. This module therefore
// splits its boundary in two, and only one half is allowed to matter:
//
//   observed{}  — measured during execution ONLY: counters that increment,
//                 lengths of arrays of recorded incidents, values re-derived
//                 from the per-run entries. Nothing here is an author's
//                 sentence. verifyRehearsalReceipt gates on these.
//   declared{}  — author assertions. EXPLICITLY NON-LOAD-BEARING. The verifier
//                 checks their SHAPE and checks that they do not shadow an
//                 observed key; it never treats one as evidence.
//
// verifyRehearsalReceipt compares observed{} against REHEARSAL_EXPECTATIONS,
// which is authored independently of every value the receipt is written from
// (the receipt's numbers come from live counters and from re-derivation over
// receipt.runs), and it RECOMPUTES `passed` rather than reading it. It also
// recomputes the entire aggregate from receipt.runs, so a single flipped
// number cannot survive: forging a clean rehearsal requires rewriting twelve
// run entries and seventy-two round entries consistently AND satisfying the
// expectation table AND the cross-bindings (for example
// observed.custodyResponseReadsObserved must equal the number of resolved
// turns derived from the runs).
//
// HONEST LIMIT, stated rather than buried: this receipt is tamper-EVIDENT, not
// tamper-PROOF. It carries no signature over itself, so a party who can rewrite
// the whole artifact can produce a self-consistent clean one. What the split
// buys is that no single edit, and no re-signed single edit, passes — which is
// exactly the property the previous claim boundary did not have.
//
// PROVIDER-CALL MEASUREMENT — the one number that must never be a literal.
// The conductor installs a counting FENCE over globalThis.fetch for the
// duration of the rehearsal and hands the SAME fence down to every turn
// executor as `fetchImpl`. Every call increments a real counter and records its
// target; a call to an ABSOLUTE http/https URL is additionally counted as a
// PROVIDER call and REFUSED by throwing. Both halves matter: the count is a
// measurement, and the throw means a provider call that does happen also
// corrupts the turn it happened in, so the incident shows up in the per-run
// entries as well as in the counter.
//
// THE CLASSIFICATION RULE, stated because it was written in response to a real
// observation rather than in anticipation of one. The first fenced run recorded
// exactly one call, to `/holoscript_wasm_bg.wasm` — the HoloScript core parser
// initializing its own WASM binary while loading the frozen `.hs` sources. That
// is not a provider call and cannot become one: Node's fetch rejects a relative
// URL outright, so a non-absolute target has no network to reach. The fence
// therefore counts it, PUBLISHES it in nonProviderFetchCallTargets, delegates it
// to the original fetch so the parser's behavior is not perturbed by the
// measurement, and excludes it from providerFetchCallsObserved by a stated rule
// rather than by omission. Only providerFetchCallsObserved is gated to zero.
//
// Coverage limit, stated plainly: the fence covers the global `fetch` binding
// (which is what MV-B1's executeCertifiedModelTurn resolves at call time, via
// its `fetchImpl = globalThis.fetch` default parameter) and the injected
// handle. It does NOT cover a module that captured a reference to fetch before
// installation, a raw node:http/https socket, or a child process. This module
// claims a measured zero over absolute-http fetch, and only that.

 * once, a partial trailing block (bounded smoke) may not repeat one, and every
 * runId recomputes from its own (blockId, condition) pair — so a rewritten
 * block or condition cannot keep its old identity.
 *
 * EVERY IDENTITY FIELD DERIVED FROM THE SAME PAIR IS RE-DERIVED (added
 * 2026-07-28). Pinning `runId` alone left three siblings — `validatorId`,
 * `runDirectory` and each round's `roundRunId` — carrying only an
 * assertNonEmptyString, even though the conductor emits all three as pure
 * functions of the same (blockId, condition) pair. That gap was not theoretical:
 * a two-field intra-block condition PERMUTATION (swap `condition` between two
 * runs of the same block and recompute `runId` + `receiptChainRoot`) preserved
 * the per-block condition SET, so the "repeats a condition" rule never fired and
 * the "pair derives" rule was satisfied by the recomputed runId — and the whole
 * gate exited 0 while runs[0] read condition=adapter_a_only against a
 * validatorId, runDirectory and roundRunIds all still naming `mixed`. Three
 * independent contradictions sat in the artifact, uninspected. They are
 * inspected now, with data the receipt already carried.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT PROVE, measured rather than guessed (probe run
 * 2026-07-27 against the twelve-run artifact at
 * .tmp/hololand/model-village/rehearsal-receipt.json). This law pins the day
 * LABEL to a position; it does not bind an EXECUTION to a day. A forgery that
 * leaves every identity field where the plan puts it but SWAPS the executed
 * payloads between two runs — turnRounds, decisionCounts, runManifestHash,
 * seatBindingHash, aliasCommitmentReceiptHash — and then rebuilds
 * receiptChainRoot, every entryHash, the aggregate and the receiptHash still
 * verifies clean today. (The identity fields named above can no longer travel
 * with such a swap; the opaque per-run hashes still can.) The receipt cannot
 * catch it because it carries the run manifest only as an opaque hash: there is
 * no manifest body in the artifact to re-derive the runId from. Closing that
 * needs the signed run manifest to commit to its own runId and the receipt to
 * carry enough of it to check, which is a conductor emission change, not a
 * verifier change, and is deliberately NOT claimed here.

 * "Certify adapters" at T-3 (plan line 727), AFTER the T-7 dress rehearsal
 * (line 726). At T-7 there are no live certifications to hold, and producing
 * one requires probing a live route — which is precisely what a zero-provider-
 * call rehearsal must not do. The rehearsal therefore runs on fixture
 * certifications and SAYS SO: the emitted rehearsal receipt pins
 * declared.certificationProvenance to 'rehearsal-fixture-not-live-probe'.
 *
 * `revisionEvidence.tier` is 'server-reported' because MV-B1's verifier pins
 * that value; it is a SHAPE requirement of the receipt family, not a claim by
 * this module that a server reported anything.

 * Executes the twelve-run dress rehearsal.

 *   (1) verify source/policy/kernel/vocabulary/assignment hashes  [study load]
 *   (4) validate and seal only the next run manifest              [sign + fleet-verify]
 *   (5) clone a clean shard and prove no cross-run state          [measured]
 *   (6) stage six unique resident and seat IDs                    [seat bindings]
 *   (7) execute with no prompt edits, fallback, or enhancement    [frozen template]
 *   (8) close the run and verify receipt completeness + chain root
 *   (9) replay captured responses                                 [layer 2]
 *  (10) tear down the shard
 *  (11) decide integrity disposition while outcomes stay blinded
 *
 * `runLimit` exists ONLY for a bounded smoke (a fast structural probe of the
 * composition) and it cannot forge a full rehearsal: the twelve-run plan is
 * still built and validated at twelve before it is sliced, and a receipt with
 * fewer than twelve runs is REFUSED by verifyRehearsalReceipt under the default
 * REHEARSAL_EXPECTATIONS — aggregate.villageRunsExecuted is derived from
 * receipt.runs.length, so a short run is self-identifying and no caller can
 * pass one off as the acceptance artifact.

  // threaded onto `nowFn` reach the receipt only through hashes that are on
  // the variance allowlist for unrelated reasons (the alias draw), and were
  // therefore invisible to it: deleting `nowFn` from the createTurnScheduler
  // options — the deepest and most load-bearing of the six — left the gate
  // exit 0 while every round receipt carried real millisecond wall-clock
  // stamps again.
  //
  // These samples close that. Every value this function derives from the clock
  // is recorded here, and at emission time, IF the injected clock is measurably
  // frozen (see `clockFrozen` below: nowFn() has not advanced across the whole
  // ~37s rehearsal, which the real clock cannot do), every sample must equal
  // it. A site that stops reading nowFn produces a different number and the

  // signing time) it is a CONTAINMENT assertion over its own writes, not

  // reading the injected clock. For the scheduler round stamps it is genuine
  // cross-module evidence — the timestamp is produced inside

/**
 * WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, AND WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT FIX.
 *
 * The runtime-closure gate row was named "Seed and deterministic clock" and
 * NOTHING in this lane had ever compared two executions. Measured at HEAD
 * (2026-07-27, two read-only two-run executions in one process): 53 of 271
 * receipt leaves differed, including rehearsalRoot, every runManifestHash,
 * every receiptChainRoot and every round terminal hash. The gate was named for
 * a property no artifact tested.
 *
 * THE SEED HALF OF THAT NAME IS DISPROVEN AND IS NOT IMPLEMENTED. A seed
 * parameter was NOT added, because there is nothing left for it to seed. The
 * rehearsal draws randomness in exactly two places, and both are blinding
 * material that MUST be fresh:
 *   - the alias -> route draw (`routes[randomInt(routes.length)]`), which is a
 *     CSPRNG draw precisely because an earlier finding in this lane established
 *     that a deterministic assignment is a function of public source and
 *     therefore not sealed at all; and
 *   - `routeCommitmentSalt: randomBytes(32)`, the hiding salt of that same
 *     commitment.
 * Every other value in the rehearsal is already a pure function of frozen
 * source. Adding a `seed` option that no genuinely-deterministic code path
 * consumed would be decorative width — the exact failure this lane keeps
 * shipping — so the name is corrected instead of satisfied.
 *
 * THE CLOCK HALF IS IMPLEMENTED: runRehearsal now takes `nowFn` and threads it
 * through its own timestamps AND into createTurnScheduler, whose nowFn seam had
 * existed unused since it shipped.
 *
 * WHAT REMAINS PERMITTED TO VARY is pinned below and is NOT a free-form escape
 * hatch. Four rules make it teeth rather than decoration:
 *   (1) the two receipts must have IDENTICAL leaf-path sets — a field that
 *       exists in one execution and not the other is a failure, not a diff;
 *   (2) any differing leaf whose path is not matched by a pinned pattern fails;
 *   (3) a pinned pattern that matches NO path in the receipt fails — so a
 *       rename cannot leave a silently permissive entry behind; and
 *   (4) a pinned pattern whose matched paths did not actually DIFFER fails — so
 *       the list cannot be padded with stable fields to widen the exemption.
 * Rules (3) and (4) are what stop a new nondeterministic field from being
 * absorbed: it lands on no pattern, so rule (2) reds.
 *
 * FALSE-POSITIVE RATE. Every pinned entry is either a 256-bit digest downstream
 * of a fresh CSPRNG draw and a fresh 32-byte salt (probability of two
 * executions agreeing is ~2^-256, i.e. it will not happen) or `runDirectory`,
 * which differs whenever the two executions were given different scratch roots
 * — asserted by this function rather than assumed. There is no probabilistic
 * detector here and therefore no power calculation to pin: the comparison is
 * exact equality over the whole artifact.
